// JS is..

// weakly typed
//  in JS, values have types, but variables do not
//  also, objects are not tied to classes as their "type definition"
//  and can change in structure throughout their lifetime

// object-based
//  not "object-oriented" since classes are not fundamental

// interpreted, not compiled

// JS was designed for the browser, to give
//  webpages (in HTML) extra behavior "client-side JS"
// these days, there are JS engines (runtimes)
//   separate from the browser, from any HTML page,
//   able to talk to the filesystem, etc "server-side JS"

// JS was standardized as "ECMAScript" or ES.
// ES3
// ES5 fixed a lot of inconsistent behavior, silent errors into visible errors, added "strict mode"
// <--- browser lowest common denominator
// ES6 (ES2015) - added classes, arrow functions, block scope
// ES7 (ES2016) - async i think?
// etc (up to 2021 now)
